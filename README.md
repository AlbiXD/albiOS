# albiOS (MY VERY OWN OPERATING SYSTEM!)

Welcome to the repository for my custom operating system project! This is a work in progress, and its primary purpose is to deepen my understanding of low-level system programming, operating system concepts, and hardware interaction.

## ðŸš§ Current Status
This project is still in its early stages. Hereâ€™s what I've accomplished so far:
<ul> 
  <li>
    Bootloader: Successfully initializes the system and loads the kernel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Basic Kernel: Simple functionality like VGA text mode output. (Added a print and putchar).
  </li>
</ul>


## Why I'm Building This?
<p> What better way to learn how the computer works than by implementing a software that communicates with it directly! </p>
